Good stuff!  I spent most of my time working with the pen tool, making shapes - modifying them - filling them and so on.  I was able to make some nice shapes and the auto-smoothing worked well.  I found it easy to move points within shapes using the modify tool (if that's what it's called).  Adding new points worked most of the time but had difficulty at other times.  Deleting points was not intuitive - but I had read in this forum that shift click was the way to go so I tried that and it worked.
One issue I see, though, is that of making more complex shapes.  In most vector editors, you can group entities together to make a set of primitives act as a unit.  Sometimes you can even group splines together to share a common fill boundary.  I'm curious if we are going to have features like that here?  I often find that I want to start with a simple curve, perhaps duplicate it, mirror it, then join it to the first curve to make a symmetrical closed shape, then fill it  How can I do that here?
I have found that when I fill an open shape, it leaves the boundary line off the open segment - and I think that's good.  Because then, I can overlap a couple of open shapes (filled with the same color) and kind of mimic a more complicated fill.  But, unfortunately, if I use the modify tool to adjust any of the points of the filled open shape - it automatically gets closed.  That may be helpful in some circumstances - but is not a help in the case I just described.  Perhaps there should be an option to close an open shape rather than have it close whenever it is edited.
I can see good progress here - and I am encouraged by what I see.  It's still going to be a tough job balancing functionality with simplicity.  Maybe there could be advanced functionality available off of a context sensitive alt-menu, similar to how things work in the script editor?  Things like “Close”,“Mirror”,“Group”,“Move to Layer” and so on.
