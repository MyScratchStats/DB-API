Well, most of the time when I use it, I get a BSOD (if you don't know what a Blue Screen of Death is,
this will help you
)
When this occured, at the top it said “System_Service_Exception” and at the bottom it was dumping error memory dump files, or whatever. Of course I know Ram Dumps when talking about wiis, but Windows 7 Inspiron Intel Pentium Computers, not really
Here's Info from a screen that just popped up.

So is it just me, or is the camera block causing Blue Screens of Death on some of you?
(oh forgot, I had an SD card while using it)
Help me if possible
