The most efficient way that I would try in a normal programming language with networking is the broadcast approach with separate server and client values, of course. That's pretty much how all programs work, I believe.
To do that I need to be able to write both code on the server and in a matching client handler, and have the “broadcasts” be able to actually carry values.
That makes it a bit difficult to implement in a language like Scratch and without your own server!
