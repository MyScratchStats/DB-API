Once logged in, I checked out cloud variables, the main page and my stuff; these were things I hadn't seen much before.
I hope comment deletion will be posible (see my page's comments
) and I also am a little concerned about uability on iOS; will logging in be possible?
I'm a huge fan of cloud variables, the new forums and the personal page customization.
