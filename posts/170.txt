I
love
it! The first thing I did was log in and see the newsfeed. Then I saw a mail icon with a big 86 on it, so I clicked it. Turns out at tat last time the website was cached, I had 86 messages… sorry about that. The tabs on the message page don't seem to work, BTW.
I love the editools on the forums, including new features like lists, strikethrough, and font size control. This will make BBCode so much easier for newbies!
A couple questions: were only a few people invited to try it out? If so, are we allowed to discuss/mention it on the main site? It may make a couple Scratchers jealous.
Also, will this continue to be up for us until it's released?
