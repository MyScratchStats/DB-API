Thanks everyone! Good to know most of you feel we're on the right track.
It's looking like we'll release with no limit to the number of tags an author can create. But it should be easy to place a limit later if we need to.
If you don't put in a limit, some people will work very hard to maximize it, adding a bunch of spam to the database.  They will do this just for the bragging rights of having “the most tags”.  Please reconsider and put a limit on it, even if it's something totally ridiculous like 20.
I agree.
For this project:
http://alpha.scratch.mit.edu/projects/10000339/?mode=player
I can think of “Scratch, Gobo, Cat, Survey, Vote!, 2.0” and that'll double when a project is more advanced…so maybe 15?
