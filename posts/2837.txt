I feel the need to bump this… the bug hasn't been fixed, and the situation has only gotten worse in the latest version(s) of the flash player. Now the background-stage of my project won't update. The Stage and a sprite called Stage should be treated as two separate identities, in order to prevent the breaking of projects made in Scratch 1.4 and earlier! A compromise could be made possible (since I understand the confusion of having a sprite called “Stage” and the actual stage called “Stage”), but just leaving projects like mine broken because of it doesn't seem fair.
