I've been laying around with the time blocks and love the new feature, it will help with a lot of things.
However, there seem to be two uses of the time reporter and the current system doesn't support both of them. The two uses that all time project use are:
Local Time
Projects that want to accommodate each user the best; projects that use this might be clocks and OS projects.
Standard Time
Projects that are interactive across users mostly want to use this. An example would be my Chat Pro project; it adds the time of each message posting infront of messages. However, when two or more people chat, one might have the time “12:0:49” but user 2 that's in a different time zone will have “14:0:49” instead, making it really confusing, you don't know which time zone, it could have been the next day when that was posted.
I think the best solution to this problem, one that would make the best of both worlds is a reporter that's in the form of (time in  using ) where you can select the time zone, including one option that's “local time” and one that's Scratch Time. This would eliminate all these problems and make everyone happy.
