Please create a separate topic for each suggestion you have, rather than creating a list of suggestions.  That way, the conversation stays focused and each idea can get the attention it needs.
Before making a new topic, please check out the following:
The Official List of Rejected Suggestions
.  If your suggestion is in this list, please do not make a new topic about it, as it will not be implemented anyway.
The Suggestions Directory
.  If your suggestion is in this list, please continue the discussion in the existing topic, rather than making a new topic.
Thank you!
