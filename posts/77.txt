Is it possible to access the source of this site?
Not yet. It's likely we'll release it once it's finished, but not a sure thing.
It would be really weird for me if with the release of 2.0 people can't see the source anymore. Like, Scratch has always been OSS.
I don't think it was right at the release of the website, but I could be wrong about that. Anyway, I think we will probably still release it under and FOSS license. The stuff with Scratchy Scratch making their own site kinda rattled us a bit, to be honest.
