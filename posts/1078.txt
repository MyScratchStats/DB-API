On my personal laptop, I ran Chrome and opened the console before I went to my chess game.
The only error message I saw was:
GET
http://alpha.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static//css/modules/popover.css
404 (Not Found)
But, when I clicked the “see inside” button, it went into the editor as expected.  So I could not duplicate the error.
Next, I ran it on IE.  I got the following JavaScript error on the page:
Webpage error details

One interesting thing I noticed, when the “see inside” button is working, it goes to the url
http://alpha.scratch.mit.edu/projects/2737104/?mode=editor
When it is not working, it goes to the url
http://alpha.scratch.mit.edu/projects/2737104/?mode=editor#?mode=editor&_suid=13504506090130396451916909365
Does this info help you?  Do you need anything else?
