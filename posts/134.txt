So it looks like Lucario beat me to it on the other thread.
You actually can choose whether you want people to be able to vote more than once or only one time. There is a user id block which can be used to only let people vote a certain amount of times.
Now I have another question.
Is there a way to make it so people have to wait a certain amount of time to post again?
