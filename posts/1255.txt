Is there another way of selecting? Or, if forcing a shape to the top layer is the only way to move a shape, is there a way to control which layer an object is located?
We don't currently have plans to support controlled layers. We're trying to balance simplicity and control. Can you describe (or even better create a sample project) with the use case where you think controlled layers would be most useful?
Thanks!
