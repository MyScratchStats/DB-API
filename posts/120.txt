The style is quite a change from the current Scratch website, but I think it's fine
The My Stuff page is very streamlined, I like it.
Great! Yes, things are still works in progress though. In this thread, we're especially interested in hearing how things go for you - what you expected to be different, or were confused by, as well as what you think could be better.

I really like the cloud thingy. I like seeing how long i've been on. And how this little chat thingy.
I think the scratch team did really good! It was defiantly worth the wait. Keep up the good work!
Awesome! Glad you like. As you spend more time on the site, feel free to post more in this or other threads on the feedback forum. We're really interested in what you have to say!
