As you begin to use the prototype, we would love to know your initial thoughts and experiences. Sometimes those first moments can tell a lot about what is easy or confusing. Here are some questions to help you think about your initial experiences:
* What were your initial series of actions on the prototype?
* What did you find confusing or frustrating?
* What features did you like?
P.S. Don't be afraid to be really honest – our feelings will not be hurt!
