can't you just edit the size to this though by just editing the tag
I was wondering….maybe make an auto lock or something like that for the big & small thing.
Edit:
Also, you could make a header thingamagig thing in the forum options for you to choose where you can put a certain heading. Maybe max 50 characters for a header so no spammers and a bigger size font choice for the heading. And lock the body to maximum of 32.
