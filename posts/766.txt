This is great! I know that sounds weird, but if you've found a bad bug, it'll help us figure it out now, so others won't have to deal with it / so we can tell them workarounds.
First of all, this is something that's definitely Adobe's fault - they're in charge of not crashing no matter what an application (like ours) asks them to do. However, we can try to file a bug with them, or maybe understand what causes it better if you give us some more info.
Can you go to the adobe site and tell us the version of Adobe Flash you are using? This page gives the info we need:
http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/find-version-flash-player.html
Also, what version of Firefox are you using? (and what version of bodhi linux?)
Thanks!
Oh and btw there's a recent post that has lots of discussion on the paint editor here:
