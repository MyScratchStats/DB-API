* What were your initial series of actions on the prototype?
First thing I did was log in, then I clicked the messages and my stuff icons next to my username, wondering what they do. Next I went to the forums, and was quite surprised to see the dustbin forum readable O.o
Finally, I played around with my profile, and posted a reply to a comment on my profile by JJROCKER
* What did you find confusing or frustrating?
Well, I found a project in my trash folder which I don't remember making, plus the account settings and profile link seem to take me to the same place.
* What features did you like?
I really like the new features on the my stuff and profile pages, especially the featured project thing, which I presume would be able to be changed in the account settings, once that's built?

I wanted to know, are we allowed to make projects yet?
