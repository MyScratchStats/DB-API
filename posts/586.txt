BoltBait
This idea has definate ways to abuse:
when stop pressed
forever
play really_annoying_sound.wav until done
end
EDIT: If you just want to know if the stop sign has been pressed, I did create a dector project here:
http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/BoltTest/2800099
Would this do?
The problem is some code would have to be executed after the stop sign to deal with the cloud variables.
