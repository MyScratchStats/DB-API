I also just got the bug.
I don't know how I got it to happen. Today I just logged in, and BAM! No text.
The problem is that the bug is on ALL of my projects, and when I create a new one - it's there too!
Windows 7
Google Chrome
Flash version 11. something. Probably the same as zorket above, as there is no other 11. something flash version, I think.
So, I'm kinda stuck. Not able to create any projects, as far as I know. NOOOOOO!!!
