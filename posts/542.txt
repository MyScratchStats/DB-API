I had the same problem. I'm thinking that it is the resolution or physical size of the screens on our computers. I'm using a laptop and having this problem. Sometimes websites are designed on a bigger screen and aren't used to fitting in smaller areas.

Thing is, it doesn't happen to everyone (including me).
I even tried it on a smaller screen (even tiny) and nothing was wrong!
With chrome?
Yeah, Chrome for Windows latest stable version.
