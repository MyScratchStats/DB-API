Just pointing out that the quote button in the edittools should ask for the person to quote (and not include the equals sign if blank is given).
Or if the user clicks “cancel” when prompted for the username. Also, quotes should ideally link to the quoted post if you get to it via the quote button, but that's a minor quip.
