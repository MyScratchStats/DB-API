But they could definitely add user notifications when a user is referenced!!!
I am definitely looking for that feature:
When typing @LS97 on the forums it should notify me.
Worries of abuse? Put limits…
No, I think atom feeds are pretty easy on the server - just text. So: Thanks for the report! Yeah it looks like there's more config work to do. We'll add that to the list!
Why did you quote me without giving me an answer?
Oh, you mean to the idea of typing @ls97 and what not?
That's still a possibility for the main site, but I'm not so sure about the forums.
It could have some advantages, but one question to ask is: why haven't many other forum / social sites done the same (or have they?) I imagine your messages could get flooded pretty quickly.
I know Facebook does it.
Facebook and Twitter only to name a couple.
It can be abused if there are no measures put in place. For example, to prevent over-tagging:
- only notify once per post, ignore further tags
- set a limit as to how many tags a user can send out in a period of time
- implement abuse reporting right into the notification
- don't allow admins (and possibly moderators) to be tagged
- allow people to turn this type of notification off
I think it's a lot more useful on the forums than the main site: on the main site it's easy to just go to a user's latest project and talk to them about something. On the forums, you sometimes want someone's opinion but can't always attract their attention.
