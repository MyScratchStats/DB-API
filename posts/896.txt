I think the vector is a gorgeous addition, and I'm loving it so far. A few problems are, I can't find a ‘delete’ or an ‘undo’ button, so my sprites aren't as good as I like. Despite that, things like the auto-corrections that the computer makes really pleases me. I think that the project editor might just be the best part of Scratch 2.0!
