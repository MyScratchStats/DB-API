I've noticed that when you try to move/edit scripts while the green flag is active, everything moves very slowly. The solution is just to stop the project from playing and then edit, of course. I thought this was interesting though that it lags so much more when this happens.
That is interesting, and not something I've seen yet. Can you link us to a project that demonstrates this? We'll hit green flag and then start editing, and see if we can see what you do.
Most any program that has lag itself will cause lag in the editor.  For example
http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/11852885/#editor
Click a bunch of times to get the wave moving, then try to move some blocks.
Even in this simple project, the editor lags more as the clones load.
http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/11721652/#editor
Turn the clone know on this project up to 300, then go in the editor.  You should see significant editor lag.
