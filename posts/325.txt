For me it seems a bit too specific and I'm not sure how often it would be used.
I think it would be better if you could set the date.
No, definitely not setting the date!
That would make it extremely confusing to anybody who looked at the scripts!
Agreed. Imagine trying to piece together something like:
(join ((((days since (10).(1).(2012)) * (24))*(60))*(-1)) )
