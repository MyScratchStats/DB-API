Nope.  I can't see inside ANY project right now.
I've even cleared my cache (just incase it was my web problem).  Nothing's working.
EDIT:
UGH! This is very frustrating.  I had planned to do a bunch of development on my next project today.  I had set aside some time today to learn about cloud variables and how they work.  The fact that I can't even open the project editor makes today a wasted day for me.
