The transition to vector is really nice and Flash is a good opportunity to make this step. However I feel like it will take some time to adapt to a new style of painting in Scratch, especially since some standards of vector editors have been missed out:
When (in the future) a non-vector image is imported, how will one be able to edit it, since there is no erase tool?
Also, clicking on the transparent background will the arrow should clear the selection of any item.
The pen icon is cool, but a hollow circle for larger pen sizes would really help. The same goes for a precision pointer when inserting shapes.
The icons are also pretty ambiguous (especially those that appear on a selection), so tooltips would help.
The shift clicking to change the behaviour of a tool is a great idea, but should be made more obvious (I had a hard time finding lines). There are also bugs with that, but I won't go into them.
And then. How does one change the colour of the background?
