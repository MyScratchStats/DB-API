This should help clarify:

We just invited about 100 or so new testers, but many of them may be inactive (past curators from a long time ago, especially).
Your projects *may* come with you when we release, but we can't guarantee it, so if you really love something, you should download a copy and save it. Even that we can't totally guarantee, b/c we might have to change the format a little, but that seems less and less likely as time goes on.
Also, how much can we reveal to the public? Screenshots? Info?
It's fine to talk about the stuff you see here publicly - but we ask that you always mention that Scratch 2.0 isn't released yet, so features you are talking about / showing pics of may change, or even get taken out before the final release.
If your friends / other Scratchers have thoughts or suggestions related to different features you've shown them / told them about, by all means, please post a synopsis here.
Awesome! Just to clarify, it's okay to post screenshots too?
Sure! Just don't forget the caveats mentioned above!
