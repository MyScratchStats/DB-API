I am definitely looking for that feature:
When typing @LS97 on the forums it should notify me.

Oh, you mean to the idea of typing @ls97 and what not?
That's still a possibility for the main site, but I'm not so sure about the forums.
It could have some advantages, but one question to ask is: why haven't many other forum / social sites done the same (or have they?) I imagine your messages could get flooded pretty quickly.
I know Facebook does it.
