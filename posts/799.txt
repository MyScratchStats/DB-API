Yech! Well, that's a bad flash bug. You might try checking to see if you have the latest version, and updating otherwise (in case they've fixed this).
So, our site can ask Flash to do stuff, but doesn't really have the power to BSOD it - that it can only do to itself. Hopefully Adobe will / has fixed it. But it would be good to know how many others are experiencing it.
Thanks, hope you find a solution
