I'd like to follow people, but the follow button doesn't seem to work.
Oops, it did at one point. Must've gotten broken in the recent update. That's a bug - thanks!
There is no follow button for me!
Do you have adblock or adblock+? I've heard that it sometimes blocks the follow button.
Also, please try not to post on really old topics like this one. (Notice how the last reply was over two years ago, and the issue is only sort of related). Instead, create a new topic about it. (However, make sure that there aren't recently active topics about it.
)
