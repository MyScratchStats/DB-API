I made a project today called click me! While I was working on it, the script looked sort of like this!
When green flag clicked
Say hello! 2 secs
I was just invited to test scratch 2.0! 4 secs
I'm so excited! 4 secs
Then I tried it. It only said hello! then said nothing else. How odd is that? Neverless, Scratch Rocks!
