I think that Scratch 2.0 is pretty cool! The paint editor is not how I expected it, though, but that's ok because it's not done yet. I'm still confused about Scratch 2.0, but I am pretty sure that it will turn out good! Just a question: If I'm switching Scratch accounts, can I use my new one one on this website, too?
P.S: My sister, Thunderclaw-, thinks it's unfair that I get the access code and she doesn't.
Anyway, Scratch 2.0 is gonna be AWESOME! And I'm pretty proud to be a tester.
