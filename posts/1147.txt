Keep in mind the “clone startup” block would also have to be modified to keep up with the new blockspecs.
[clone {clone ?} startup]
Disagree.
Remember, a “CLONE STARTUP” script is located inside the sprite that is being cloned.  And, it gets fired off only for that specific clone when that clone is created.
So that won't be necessary.
