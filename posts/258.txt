I'm guessing not - it probably wouldn't be fair to other people with test accounts too. I don't really think there's much of a need for two accounts though; if testing cloud variables is what you're trying to do, you should be able to ask other people to check out your project or something. Besides, you can always wait until 2.0 is released…
