Another thing, don't use IE 9
While I agree with that sentiment generally, it's actually quite helpful that BoltBait is using it now.
None of the Scratch Team use Windows, so we don't tend to encounter Windows related glitches. However, a great deal of Scratchers do use IE, so it's very helpful to have these issues reported.
re: Dirty Bit. Yes, that's definitely a bug! Can you file it in the tracker if you haven't already?
My understanding is that autosave should not come into play at all unless you've opened the project in “edit” mode. So, something's wrong there.
Seems like the quote handling in comments (and the lack of rotation for feedback) are also solid glitches.
If you have any trouble with the bug tracker, let me know and I'll sort it out - you should be squared away though.
Edit: Ack, looks like I hadn't set proper perms for you on the bug tracker previously - apologies for any confusion! You should be set up to report against any of the projects now.
