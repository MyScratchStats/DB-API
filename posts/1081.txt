# https://github.com/lightnin/DjangoBB/blob/master/djangobb_forum/forms.py
# lines 248  to 251 to end of -- replace with:
html = convert_text_to_html(profile.signature, self.profile.markup)
if (len(html)<=400 and html.count("<br>")<=1): # if length is less than or equal to 400, and there are 2 or fewer lines
profile.signature_html = html
if commit:
profile.save()
else:
# load an error page which explains the restrictions
# i think the code is: raise forms.ValidationError(_("Explain restrictions here!"))
return profile
Ideally this should work.
Use it
here
.
P.S. So you guys are actually going to implement polls?
