They do, but not to the public I think, unless you properly press save.
That is a super interesting assumption!
Nope, they live update.  Also, the save button is going away soon. (No saving allowed!)
It's going to be tough for some of us, but we need to embrace the new world of autosave.
I think that's less confusing for new users, and better all around.
Aww, I liked my assumption more!
Are you really sure you want to do this?
Remember that big projects are always updated, but also constantly viewed. What happens when someone is updating their project and suddenly a random viewer tries to play a temporarily broken project? What a famous person wants is a project that is online all the time, that works, and that can be updated freely.
There are a couple of solutions to that, using the system that is made available to them:
• They can un-share the project while they work on it – this isn't what you want for a popular project
• They can copy the project and work on the new one, and then take off the old one when they share the new – this is definitely not a good idea because you don't want the URL changing on every update and glitch fix
• They can download it to the offline editor (assuming it's still planned) and then re-upload it – what a hassle, and not the point of so much work on an online editor!
By removing a button you're adding more tricky steps. Not exactly what I envisage for a kids community.
Exactly. I found a bug with my newest project, which is currently featured, but I can't fix it because someone could be viewing it and that could cause all kinds of problems.
Autosaving is a good idea, but you should be able to update your project manually.
