I remember when you were curator… you had some cool picks.
Why thank you!
I liked them too, but they seem to have disappeared from my favourites! I'm not sure if I was the one who deleted them or they were deleted automatically after I finished my shift…
Weren't auto-deleted for me… you must have done it on your own.
Bug report: On Mac OSX Lion, Safari 6 the forum gets these weird horizontal lines every few pixels. Also, the COLOR BBCode isn't in the editools, so
testing
. Also, my “what I'm working on” doesn't save, and the section above that is literally 2px too short to fit my description.
I'm using the same OS+browser as you, and I had similar problems. There are greyish lines on the forums sometimes, although I'll try to take a screenshot next time.
I wrote something in “What I'm working on”, but it didn't save.
