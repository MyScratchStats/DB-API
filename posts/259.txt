Lunastar-
I think that Scratch 2.0 is pretty cool! The paint editor is not how I expected it, though, but that's ok because it's not done yet. I'm still confused about Scratch 2.0, but I am pretty sure that it will turn out good!
Thanks for trying it out! I have a couple of questions for you: What were you expecting to see in the paint editor? And what do you find confusing? It's okay to let us know – your thoughts and feelings about your experience help us with our design thinking!
