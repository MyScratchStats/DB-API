The problem with private projects has to do with security, I'm afraid.
NaughtyScratcher makes project “ScratcherX sucks!”, and shares it to ScratcherX only. Not cool. Of course they would hopefully flag it, but you'd be surprised at how many people don't flag projects that are mean to them, opting instead to retaliate.
Since it's all happening in private projects, no one else flags them, and you have super-bad dramafest explosion.
That's not what I meant still
Let's say I'm working on a project and I want to shut down my computer but I'm not done yet. I want to save it but I don't want others to see it. That's what I meant by private projects, not projects that only certain people can see.
