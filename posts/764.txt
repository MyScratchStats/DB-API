Ok, it's been ages since I've been on scratch 2.0, sorry
So after a few weeks I came back to try out the paint editor, the function that annoyed me most. I'm sorry to say that the situation has not improved. It's not the tools, in fact, I can't use them as EVERY time I go to the paint editor, adobe crashes! I've tried adobe out on other sites and it's fine.
I'm using firefox on bodhi linux, and I'm up to date, if that helps.
