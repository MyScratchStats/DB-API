That finally explains your signature, sci!
I had actually been battling in the old forums to have a more lenient cutoff a while ago. Seems like it's now going to be implemented.
Now, while it's very unlikely that users will type I's in their signatures for ten lines, what really usually increases character count are images and links. There still should be a global character limit to keep the databases from exploding
, say 4000 characters, but URLs shouldn't really be counted in the 1000/1500/2000 character limit.
What do you think? Are the numbers too big?
Exactly, most people won't use 2000 “I”s, which means with 200 characters per line, you can get some decent text and link. And most people won't even approach the high 2000 character ceiling. So, i think URLs shouldn't make too much difference.
