I'm not sure if all of your messages should be marked as read as soon as you visit the messages page. That's like saying that all of your messages should be marked as read immediately when you open hotmail/gmail/outlook. Doesn't make sense to me. Perhaps you could mark individual messages as read by either clicking on them to read the message *or* clicking some kind of certain button/icon?
