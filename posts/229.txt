Hello all.
I really enjoy the new look of the website. It looks a lot nicer and I like how everything is arranged better.
I had seen some of these, when you had released it to the public for a few days, but much of it was new.
I noticed that the My Stuff and Profile pages were separate. I have seen this sort of feature on other websites, and I think that it's a great feature. That way we can have a bit more control on our page, rather than having the same view as everyone else.
I agree with LS97, that some of the rows at the bottom should be brought up a little. I'm not sure that all of them need to, but at least the Featured Projects as that is a pretty important section.
One thing I noticed pretty quickly was a bit of a styling error. I think it's more because of the smaller screen I'm viewing it on, but I still thought you should know. The more personal navigation part doesn't fully fit on the bar. I'm guessing this is not a feature.
Here's an image of it:
One more question, before I leave. What information am I allowed to give out about 2.0? I was going to perhaps add some information and images to the Wiki, if that's okay. I don't want to violate anything, so I was just checking before hand.
Thanks once again for letting me help you,
ProgrammingFreak.
