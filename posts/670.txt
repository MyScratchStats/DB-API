It seems to be that the current hour and seconds from the current block aren't working.
You are right!  Thanks for pointing that out.  The interesting thing to me is that old projects that are using them work fine, like this one:

It's only when you try and use the drop-down menu that it breaks and refuses to report hours/minutes/seconds.
