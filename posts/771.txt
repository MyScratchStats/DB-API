IE is the most used web browser in the United States and Canada.

When designing a web site, I always check to make sure it works on the top 5 browsers for desktop and 2 mobile browsers.
The development team needs to buy themselves a cheap Windows PC.  Install Windows 7, IE8/9, Chrome, and Firefox on it.  You can probably get one for $200 or less, new.
EDIT:  OK, I have logged the issues into the bug tracker.
