So, I was trying to fill a scene with black on the paint editor, and then my browser told me that Adobe Flash had crashed!
My OS: Ubuntu 12.10 Beta 2
My Browser: Mozilla Firefox
Uh oh.
I tried to reproduce on my machine (chrome, Ubuntu 12.04), but couldn't get a crash just drawing simple shapes and filling them in. Can you see if there is a definable list of steps necessary to reproduce this issue consistently? Also, flash version would help:

Thanks!
