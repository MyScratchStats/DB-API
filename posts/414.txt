I've compiled a list of all the bugs I've found in the Paint Editor.
-No undo
-Fill cannot be transparent
-Clicking a color reverts to the fill tool
-Occasionally save will not work, your drawing is then lost
-Artifacts are left on rescale, go away with zoom
-Resizing causes massive temporary distortion
