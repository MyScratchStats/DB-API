You can have them post with their actual username in the comment section so you know it's actually them.
I guess. I should have them post the userID, so then I can manually add it…
That'd work for like, Collaboration Job Boards, but not for like, normal chatrooms.
I think It would work for both. As long as the actual user says their ID, you're good.
