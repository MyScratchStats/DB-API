Yeah, the survey showed that they aren't very accurate / useful in a lot of ways.
Our current thinking is to only allow the owner of a project to make tags for it - hopefully that'll cut down on the noise some. There was some talk of limiting the number of tags as well (to maybe around 3).
Do you have any thoughts on tags?
No more tags.
I agree with Hardmath, a advanced string search would be much better.
Instead of tags as well, there could be categories? Sorta like Deviantart (like “Animation>Humor>”Say Blocks“ for a funny animation that uses blocks instead of sounds, ”Animation>Making a Point (some way to summarize?>Music)
