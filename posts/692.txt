Yeah! No settings yet.
I don't recall exactly what we're going to put in there. Perhaps the ability to set a different default sprite, and maybe some other things (preferred language). But once we populate it, we'll certainly post!
It should certainly have an option to change your country, password, email, icon.
And featured project on the user page. I'm kinda sick of seeing just the newest one all the time.
