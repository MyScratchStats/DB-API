I don't see why a collab should have its in-progress stuff private, anyway. IMO it's interesting to see a project develop from scratch (pun not intended. honest.)
But sometimes you don't want people to be like “Oh, he's working on something. It's just like this. Okay” but to surprise them when you're really done. If they want to show people, that's fine, but I think they should get a choice.
Such as Scratch 2.0. If you saw it from the very beginning, adding blocks every once in a while, it wouldn't be as exciting. But if suddenly there were tons of new blocks and a new interface etc, that'd be pretty cool, or at least more exciting.
