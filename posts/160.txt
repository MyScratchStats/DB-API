Oh my gosh - Thank you so much for this opportunity!
I just started viewing this, and I have a few questions, bugs, and opinions.
My questions:
1. Who gets to see this? My more recent accounts don't have this notification.
2. How long will I be able to use this access code, or do I get to keep it until the official release of 2.0?
3. When will this version be released? I received a very vague answer at Scratch Day and I was wondering if there is a clearer date now.
My bugs:
1. It said a project I just made in the 2.0 version was made four hours ago in “recent activity,” even though it was just moments before I read that.
2. My most recent projects and inbox messages are not listed.
My Opinion:
This is great! Everything is easier and more detailed, although considering I've been used to 1.4 (and 1.3) for 3 years, It'll take some getting used to.
Thank you again for this opportunity - this is so cool!
