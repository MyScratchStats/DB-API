Yep!
In terms of “visibility”, projects have two states:
1. Visible only to you. This is how projects start out.
2. Visible to everyone. This is how projects are after you've shared them.
There's no way to make a project private to to you and anyone(s) else. That'd break our security model, I'm afraid. We depend on openness.
That's not exactly what I meant but thank you for answering.
Let's say I work on a project but I don't want it public because It's not complete yet. How do I check if it's public or private?
