I'm doing a school project on augmented reality, and I wondered, is it possible to do this sort of thing on scratch? i.e: You show the webcam a picture, and something happens?
All suggestions welcome!
Dang, it's too bad the search is broken right now! But the answer is yes, there are lots of cool things to do with the camera.

I think we lost our old galleries a day or two ago when we migrated, and maybe some projects, so I can't find an example at the moment, but there are some cool ones!
