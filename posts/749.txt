I wouldn't mind the “auto save” feature as long as we have these two other features:
1) changes to published projects wouldn't automatically publish when the save happens.  You would still have to click a “publish changes” button to make the changes go live.
2) there would need to be a “revert to published version” button to reset all of the changes made so far that have not been published.  Of course, there would need to be a warning message box to remind the user what they're about to do.
If these conditions were met, there would still need to be a way to “see inside the published version” along with the “see inside the latest version” so that a developer could see the changes that were made and maybe copy scripts between them.
