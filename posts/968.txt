I would rather they just eliminate the small player.  I'd rather it was just a clickable thumbnail that would then take you to the actual project page in order to play the game.
From my perspective, it looks like the ST is basically going with the “YouTube” approach, so projects can be played at many different resolutions - whether it's full screen, normal size, or “minified”. I'm not sure how well it works with Scratch… but I guess vector graphics helps with that idea. Obviously not all types of animations and games will look great on a person's user page - but hopefully you could make some kind of introduction or welcoming project to put there for your visitors.
Optionally, I think it would be nice if you could feature other people's projects too (as I think some other Scratchers have suggested).
