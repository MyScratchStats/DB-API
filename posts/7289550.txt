Nope, so you just necroposted on the oldest open topic.
Okay, know that I have an answer close it. Also it is not necroposting if relevant.
It’s not, this was fixed in the official release of 2.0. Also I knew you posted here because I happened to follow this topic.
Basically, it was meant to be that if all items had length 1, there would be no spaces, but otherwise there would be.
