Well, I believe the static player is open, and they can use injected JS to manipulate it into the Scratch 2.0 editor. IMO it's not a problem. It's not exactly nice of them, but at the same time it isn't harming us, is it? Anyway, the only way to stop it would be to lock the editor page, but that is referenced by the main site to view Scratch projects. They could copy it over, but what's the use?
