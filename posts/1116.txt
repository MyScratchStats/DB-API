Or you can have two different blocks; one would clone at the location of the item cloned, and the other would clone at an (x, y) location:
[clone {cloned item ?}]
[clone {cloned item ?} at (x), (y)]
Keep in mind the “clone startup” block would also have to be modified to keep up with the new blockspecs.
[clone {clone ?} startup]
