Bump because of a
dupe

It's not a dupe, so you just bumped an old suggestion without bringing anything to the discussion.
This topic is talking about the exact same thing. Cite your sources next time.
Also worth noting that you forgot to bump this topic before you posted this, and while doing that, you added nothing to the discussion, therefore, you just necroposted.
1. No, they are very clearly different suggestions, they’re just a bit similar.
2. It’s a response to a post, specifically yours; it’s not just a random statement.
1. That’s clearly an understatement as both topics are suggesting the same thing, only worded differently.
2. You’re right about responding to a post, but bumping would’ve been more necessary in this case.

Also wasn’t there also an “Improving the Explore Page” topic
