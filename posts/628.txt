This thread is for notices about updates to the Scratch 2.0 Studio / Project Editor. It's a closed topic, so only ST can post in it. If you want to discuss an issue or glitch related to an update on this thread, please feel free to start a new discussion thread!
You'll notice that each update has a version number (e.g. “v125”). This version number is printed in the
JavaScript console
of the browser when the Scratch 2.0 Studio is loaded. For a short time after a new version is released, you may need to
clear your browser's cache
to force the latest version to be loaded. However, most people don't need to worry about this, since the browser cache will update itself in time.
Scratch On!
