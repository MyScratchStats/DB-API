I really like the new notification system. It's nice to be able to see previous things that have happened. It's also nice to see when you received a notification. But, what is this gallery called “null”? I have a couple of old messages saying that people commented on it, but it seems to not exist. I get an error page.
That sounds like a bug to me! “Null” is kind of a programmy term for “nothing”, or “no information.” So if you are seeing a gallery called null, it's a good bet that it's because something is broken!
Any chance you can tell what gallery those comments used to be on from your notifications on the old site?
Actually, if you give me the text of a couple of them, I can try to search your old notifications, and see where gallery “null” is supposed to be, and hopefully figure out what's going wrong.

There are a bunch more of these, but they're basically all the same.
