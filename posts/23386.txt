I reported some bugs like 4 months ago and still haven't been fixed either. 4 of my projects were supposed to be on the front page and never were because the front page has been broken. Lightnin said to be patient and that it was one of the things they needed to get fixed soon. I have been patient but it's been almost a month and nothing has changed
Also, wow, you're right. That does not work and makes it look unprofessional.
