Just so you know, there are also testers who've just created accounts - like educators and researchers from around the world!
So don't worry if you see a name you don't know.
Also, I just invited BoltBait, since his bug reports are so helpful.
Of course if you see someone and you're pretty sure they haven't been invited to test, please do ping us about it -
help@scratch.mit.edu
is the best way.
