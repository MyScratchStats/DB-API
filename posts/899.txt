Categories seem to destroy one of Scratch's biggest beliefs: it gives the sense that scratch is only made for those things, rather than opening it up for anyone to create anything using their imagination. I know anyone could just not categorize their project which doesn't fit any of those categories, but in my view the entire website and program should support the big ideas and beliefs.
Additionally, it would seem to make projects more generic, rather than being each Scratcher's very own creation. A controlled tags section with flag buttons, a limit to 15 and a note above them in small print asking for clean, simple and not spam tags would be good.
