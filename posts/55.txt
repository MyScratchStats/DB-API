Hey @illusionist & @Lucario621
Thanks for writing.  I'm looking at it now.  What version of Chrome are you using?
If it's still happening for you, can you press F12 to open the developer console, then post:
- Any red messages you see
- The whole page address you're on when you see them
Thanks!
Adam
