I've just tried the editor out and I'd plead to have a switch to bit-mapped editor option!Its great to have a super-duper vector drawing - advanced users will be able to achieve great things BUT it will  introduce a large barrier with younger/less able pupils and classroom educators.The “paint” concept is something that is taught/learnt as a basic skill.When I come to teach Scratch - 85% of pupils/teachers understand and can use the 1.4 editor with minimal instruction and get onto the programming side very quickly. This is a baby and bath-water situation we have here Or to put it into Scratch Language  - the low floor has been raised and increased the barrier to entry.Simon
Thanks for the feedback on this. It's something we're definitely concerned about. The hope is that the vector editor can be made clear and intuitive enough that it's almost as easy to learn as the vector editor. Many adults may not be used to it yet though, so even if we succeed with that goal, there will be a cost, since most adults are less familiar with vector editing than with bitmap editing.
But it's definitely something that's on our minds, and we're not totally sure how it'll pan out - (we'll be watching closely). Thanks for the feedback, and please do check back now and again, as the paint editor is still under heavy development. Hopefully we can still stay vector, but push that floor back down to 1.4 levels, or only slightly above.
