I think impersonations could be a big problem.
I think so too. I really wish the username reporter were available, it would eliminate this problem.
Except the username reporter would give more problems… however, those are internal problems, like
“if username=stevetheipad
broadcast ”enter chat“
else
broadcast ”YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED“”
but those would be easy to get around because it's possible to just go in and change the code and change the username to “kayybee” or “JJROCKER” etc.
That would simply be a vioation of the guidelines, you'd flag the project and it would be deleted.
i suppose, but there must be something that causes the scratch gem to not want a username reporter…
