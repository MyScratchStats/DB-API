Mostly privacy reasons. If you're going to say who has been where, you kind of need to ask their permission first. And we felt it was too hairy / confusing to have a special pop up that says “This project wants to know your username,” specially for new users and people who are afraid of technology.
Also, there's a lot of talk about chat rooms! I'm actually pretty concerned that they may not work out, and am on the fence about whether or not we should permit them at all. Chat rooms have historically been prone to drama, and difficult or impossible to moderate, especially given our resources. And we haven't yet figured out a good way to report people who put stuff that's not ok into a cloud variable (chat room).  But probably that's a different thread….
In my opinion the problem will not so much about reporting; my chat room has a great reporting feature where after three reports; the chat is closed, the problem will be mostly making sure that chat room creators implement that feature and monitor their room well. I can see the problem with chat rooms, I'll be thinking of a solution.
