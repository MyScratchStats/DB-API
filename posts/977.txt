One more thing. It also might be nice for the clones to be able to have identities.
it's possible. just make a local variable called ID and a global variable called whatever:
greenflag:
set the whatever to 1
clone startup:
set ID to whatever
change ID by 1
They'll each have their own variable called ID which contains their ID…
