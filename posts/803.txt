I'm really liking the new scene change functions - I think that these features are going to be hugely helpful to youth in coordinating complex events! Some things that struck me as odd were (a) labeling of the scenes/stage (and their distinction now) in the lower left hand part of the screen. I was inferring that the stage was whatever was currently being seen in the project display and scenes was the collections of backgrounds? Could the stage area in the lower left now be called a scene to avoid potential confusion?
(b) I was also expecting the Stage pane to show all scenes (not just the current). This would be similar to how all Sprites are displayed and would give them more equal weighting. I could see a few advantages to doing so, including that this would help me  to remember how many scenes I had, their names, and could tell me their order if they were listed in vertical column (although order is less important if you don't have a next scene command).
© I found it helpful but a little counter intuitive (and potentially prone to a lot debugging) to be able to access the start scene commands from within a sprite. Out of interest, I programmed two sprites and the Stage with contradictory commands to see which would win out when the scene changes were all prompted to do something different. Not surprisingly, nothing happened when I did this but think that this type of confusion could have some time consuming implications for youth. This could perhaps be avoided if scene change commands were only accessible from the stage? Is there a reason that I'm not thinking of currently for why they're accessible within the sprites?
In a simple project, it was helpful to program the scene change and the coordination with the Sprite all in one stack or two but on the same scripts space for the Sprite. So I could see how there could be some utility to have these accessible within the sprite. The suggestions on b might help with this as well.
