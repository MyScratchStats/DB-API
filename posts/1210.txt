Okey doke, I'm kind of having problems selecting objects. Sometimes, if I overlay objects on top of each other, clicking on one object might end up selecting the other. Is there an easier way to select object for moving/editing other than by moving the unwanted object out of the way?
We're using layering. If you draw a large circle and then a smaller circle on top of it. The smaller circle is on the top layer and you should be able to grab it and move it around. You'll also be able to grab and move around the bigger circle because even though it's below the smaller one, it's larger and not masked by it. If however, you draw a small circle (transparent fill) and a larger circle over it (also transparent fill) then the larger circle will be ‘on top’ and masking the smaller one. It sounds like this is the case you're in. If you want to move the shapes below the one you drew on top, the easiest way to do this is to select the ‘top’ shape, and click the ‘layer down’ tool you'll see at the bottom of the tool palette. Let me know if you have trouble…
Is there another way of selecting? Or, if forcing a shape to the top layer is the only way to move a shape, is there a way to control which layer an object is located?
