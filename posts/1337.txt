v 168
A few highlights:
- screen mode buttons replaced by full screen button plus a command to toggle stage size in “More” menu
- paint editor now centers costume while remembering the rotation center
(also: costume center computed from viewBox of imported sprites and imported bitmaps resized to fit stage)
- “run without screen refresh” checkbox in “make a block” dialog to replace “all at once” block
All changes:
- change save feedback to “Last saved at hh:mm”
- add “duplicate” back to costume menu
- in Scenes tab, use icons below “New scene:”  instead of the pull-down menu
- make Stage area a lighter gray
- try Stage thumbnail at the top
- remember the tab independently for stage/sprites; stage starts with scenes tab selected
- make top bar a few pixels taller (and fix layout)
- make share button gray, leave remix button orange, no icons on either
- add stage size toggle command to “more” menu
- add delete button (x) to costumes/sounds/scenes/backpack items
- new block dialog: add checkbox for “run without screen refresh”
- new block dialog: add word “options” after arrow, move down a bit, and squeeze vertical space
- hide the delete button if only one costume/scene
- bug: ‘mouse-pointer’ and ‘edge’ args confused with sprites named ‘mouse’ and ‘edge’ when reading old projects
- bug: hidden sprites do not respond to “touching mouse”
- bug: whirl graphic effect is off-center when viewing a project in full screen mode
- fix stage top color in playerOnly full-screen mode (should be black)
- bug: draggable sprites responding badly to sprite movement blocks while being dragged
- bug: Shift-Click Green Flag doesn't enable Turbo Mode
- bug: “stop all” block should stop sound clips that are running
- resize imported images (e.g. photos) to fit stage
- implement “run without screen refresh” for procedures
- make old warp block work without warping (so old uses will work, but not at warp speed)
- handle centering of SVG in editor while retaining the costume center
- set costume center of imported SVG's based on viewBox or width/height attributes of top-level SVG
- increased scroll wheel speed
- set “saveNeeded” flag when block parameters are editor or user drag-n-drop on stage
