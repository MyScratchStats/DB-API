Clones should go to their creator upon creation (keep it the way it is now)
No, clones should inherit
everything
from their parents: pen color/shade/size, position, direction, speech bubble, temporary variables' current values, size, volume, current answer from ask block, etc.
I think that would be ok if there was a way for a clone to go to its creator upon creation. A “go to: creator” option in the “go to: sprite” block would do the trick, but I'm not sure that is necessary.
If all properties
except
location were inherited, I think that would be much easier.
