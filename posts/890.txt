Sorry for responding so late, I haven't been on very frequently. Thank you for choosing me to test this. I think that the prototype is very well thought out. But I have noticed some things that I don't particularly like.
1. When loving and favoriting projects, I like the general layout, but I think that it might be better if the hover color was a little bit lighter than the clicked color(red for love, yellow for favorite).
2. Something I noticed about the original Scratch website, which apparently prevails as an issue today, is getting a project's full name when it is too long to fit below the picture. In the first site, you roll over it. Sometimes, though, it doesn't work, and gives a … even when rolled over. Here there is no evident attempt of getting the full name. I do like the scrolling through projects though.
3. I think that the words “Mark it up!” in this box should go outside of the box, to see the words more clearly.
4. Maybe the envelope and Scratch folder icons could say “Notifications” and “My Stuff” when rolled over.
Other than this, the fluentness and simple user interface are very good. Keep up the good work, and Scratch On!
