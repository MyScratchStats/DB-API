Hey there I'm making a user online tracker, and I was thinking it would be useful if we had some sort of “when Stop Sign pressed” Event, then it would be useful to know if the person is online or not. Or something that senses if the user is viewing the project
and if they aren't on that page, then delete them from the cloud variable. But mainly the most simple helpful block that you could possibly make is a “when Stop Sign pressed” event. Thanks for viewing this and if you can, please put this in consideration as I believe this will highly benefit the scratch community.
