Im trying to make a game which will determine the attributes of a character (strength & skill) and i am not sure on how to round the overall score down to one significant figure (no decimal place). It would be a great help if someone has been in this position before and would be able to help solve this problem. It is currently very annoying and it is for a project i am currently working on which needs to be completed ASAP, so if someone could get back to me as quick as possible that would be amazing!
Many thanks
