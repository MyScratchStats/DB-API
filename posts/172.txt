I
love
it! The first thing I did was log in and see the newsfeed. Then I saw a mail icon with a big 86 on it, so I clicked it. Turns out at tat last time the website was cached, I had 86 messages… sorry about that. The tabs on the message page don't seem to work, BTW.
I love the editools on the forums, including new features like lists, strikethrough, and font size control. This will make BBCode so much easier for newbies!
A couple questions: were only a few people invited to try it out? If so, are we allowed to discuss/mention it on the main site? It may make a couple Scratchers jealous.
Also, will this continue to be up for us until it's released?
To answer one question, about 100 Scratchers were invited.
I'm special!
Guys, the preview shows up in an ugly serif font.
EDIT: What's with the weird  icons next to the topics in topic selection?
