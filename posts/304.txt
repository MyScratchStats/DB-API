I really like the new version. Just yesterday, I had a workshop with kindergarten- aged kids, and at the beginning,  they are always confused with the “looks” and “sound”, “motion” and “sensing”, “control” and “variables” blocks, most of them take a few minutes (sometimes longer than that) to realize the difference of the colors, and I think it is because they look alike on the screen.  While we are waiting for a special version for kindergarten- aged kids, we found out that our very young kids are able to program with Scratch  identifying the differences of: color, location, shape and size of the blocks and the rest of the tools.  Have you guys think about changing the color of the blocks?… it would be easier for them to identify them. I have noticed that the blocks to control WeDo are gone since the previous alpha version… now, I don't see the blocks to control PicoBoard sensors and I wonder if they will be available soon. You guys are doing a great job, and I am glad to be part of this project.
