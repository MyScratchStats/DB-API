Yep!
In terms of “visibility”, projects have two states:
1. Visible only to you. This is how projects start out.
2. Visible to everyone. This is how projects are after you've shared them.
There's no way to make a project private to to you and anyone(s) else. That'd break our security model, I'm afraid. We depend on openness.
So will there be no collaborations?
Or will they have to be public?
The only way I could think of working around that would be making a collab account.
But that seems like there should be a better way…
