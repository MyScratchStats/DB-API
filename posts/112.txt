Is it possible to access the source of this site?
Not yet. It's likely we'll release it once it's finished, but not a sure thing.
It would be really weird for me if with the release of 2.0 people can't see the source anymore. Like, Scratch has always been OSS.
I don't think it was right at the release of the website, but I could be wrong about that. Anyway, I think we will probably still release it under and FOSS license. The stuff with Scratchy Scratch making their own site kinda rattled us a bit, to be honest.
If it was someone besides SSoS, would it have bothered you?
No, not really (as long as it was clear that it wasn't “Scratch”) If that kind of thing bothered us much, we probably wouldn't have released the source code under a free license. The part that bothered us about the SSoS site was the content that attacked Scratch Team and members of the community.
