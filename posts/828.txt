I personally don't mind having purple blocks. It's a lot more colorful like the rest of the categories. I did like the brown color because it was “different” from the rest, to emphasize that it's a custom block (or a WeDo/PicoBoard block) which is special; but I'm okay with the change. I could go either way, personally.
