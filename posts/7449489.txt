as I presume this feature would replace tags, there is an obvious downside of people adding their project to unrelated categories, so I semi-support this feature to be added.
You can already do that with tags though, and it's not allowed anyway.
You probably should only be able to select a certain amount of categories.

However I've always suspected that the problem wasn't the lack of a tag limit, but the fact that anyone could tag any project and tags could be upvoted. That means that every remotely popular project had tag spam even if the creator wasn't a spammer, and also some people posted tags just to try and get them upvoted. There were also
a few projects that existed just to get people to tag them as much as possible

Welp, maybe it was all of these considering what's happening now.
