Might not be the most convenient solution, but you could certainly use “Days since 2000”, converted to whatever time  zone you wish to use.
Being that Scratch is made for young people who are just starting programming, that doesn't seem a very good solution. Mine would be fairly simple and isn't too inconvenient in my opinion.
