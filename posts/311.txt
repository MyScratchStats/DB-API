My initial action was: “Oh. Is another person trying to figure out how to use my glitchy projects?”
Then: “An admin message. Am I banned?”
Then I read it: “YAY!”
Then I was busy so: “Dang it.”
Then after I got on I was like: “This is amazing!”
But there are some things that aren't quite fixed yet.
It's amazing how you guys have managed to recreate Scratch so perfectly (almost) and with new blocks so quickly! A lot of work has been done already, yet there are still glitches.
Here
is my test for cloud variables. It works fine (I think, if I didn't mess up with the coding) but there's this list that was created and I don't know what it is. If you look at the list of lists, you can see a list that's just a dot. I'm pretty sure I didn't make that.
Also, the blocks for lists turn red… Is that normal?
Some other things: my messages (only the ones from March 23 and before or so) can't be deleted. I press the “X” and then after refreshing it's still there.
But great job, it looks amazing!
