Anyway, you can do this in combination with the days since 2000 block because it always reports in UTC, but that's difficult, so it could be like this:
(current [hour v] in UTC [+ v] () ::sensing) //meant to put it outside the dropdown lol
(difference from UTC time ::sensing)
Yes that would work. How to get this implemented?
Maybe the current block could stay there, or be converted to this?
