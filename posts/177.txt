I browsed the site a bit on my iOS device, and when I zoomed in, the header changed (or maybe not) so that I couldn't see some parts. (BTW, thanks for the epic opportunity!)
The site currently sucks on iOS devices, I can't login on my iPad.
This is good stuff to know! We're not planning on supporting i0S devices with this release (they can't run Flash, and the current site depends on Flash quite a lot). But after the release of 2.0, we're going to start thinking / working more on tablets.
