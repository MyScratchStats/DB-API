Thanks everyone for writing about your first impressions!
For those of you who have interacted with the My Stuff page, did you know that it's now a page only you can see? After playing around with 2.0, was that what you expected?
Yeah, I l like having a public and private profile. I'd like some sort of a “notepad” in my My Stuff page where I can jot down what I want to if I have a flash of inspiration/need to remember a URL.
