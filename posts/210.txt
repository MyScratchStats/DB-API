Here's a fun example!

We're going to update the homepage soon with a row that shows galleries of cool stuff you can try - one of which contains camera blocks example projects.
Stevetheipad, I think you'll be surprised by what's possible.
I hope so.
I'm going to get my hands on the project creator in the next few days, and I'll be checking everyone out including the video blocks.
