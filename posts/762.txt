Since we have an entire forum system purely for 2.0, we should take advantage of that and separate into different boards. We could have one for bugs, one for suggestions, one for the forums, and one general 2.0 discussion.
I personally don't think that's necessary (yet). The number of topics on the forum is pretty manageable so far, so adding more boards would be more useful when there are more testers, or when its closer to release.
+1 I like seeing everything  together, too.
