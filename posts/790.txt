I love the new version of the paint editor. I find it quite intuitive to use, but I have used vector editors before, so I might not be a good indication. I really like the  automatic line smoothing, especially since the curves I draw on raster editors with my mouse don't tend to be so nice and smooth looking. However, sometimes my lines smoothed more or less than I wanted them too. Small curves, for example, tended to turn into straight lines. If I remember correctly, Inkscape has a way to set the level of smoothing. Would this be a possibility?
