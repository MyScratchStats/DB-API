It works, but thank you Hardmath!
I just noticed that galleries made by a user do not seem to appear in the results (when searching for the user)!
No, none of the search really works. You can search for testers I spose.
But that's a pretty small subset of what you should be able to search for.
The reason has to do with problems importing the view tables from the old site. Search functionality depends on views, and dies without them.
OK, my bad!
