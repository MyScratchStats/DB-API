I would really like a mobile specific CSS file for the forums.
Something like this could be added to the CSS file…
<style type="text/css">
@media handheld
{
/* handheld styles */
}
</style>
I wonder if DjangoBB is working on this issue? I haven't stumbled across anything related to this yet.
Anyway - I agree this would be nice. Maybe add to tracker as feature request for forums?
Also, the forum code is here:
https://github.com/lightnin/DjangoBB
If you or any devs you know would like to work on a patch for this, I think we'd be amenable to adding it (provided it doesn't add too much complexity or create problems for non-mobile devices).
