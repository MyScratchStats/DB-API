@Natalie:
I like that clones go to their creator, that eliminates the need for a “go to: creator” option in the “go to: sprite” block…or a much much more complicated mechanism.
If clone didn't go to their creator regardless of the type of clone, this could not happen:

My only suggestions:
Clones should have the ability to copy themselves (not the sprite they are a clone of) and
Clones should go to their creator upon creation (keep it the way it is now)
I am totally satisfied with Scratch 2.0 if this is added.
