One thing we've noticed with the kids we are working with is that the available of ready-made graphics really speeds up the process.  With the new vector editor it would be great to have the ability to import editable vectors of SVG or AI files.  There are so many free vector images available online, it would be great to be able to incorporate them into projects without first converting them to bitmaps.  Perhaps there are some open source Actionscript libraries already available to handle the import.
