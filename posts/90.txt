A lot of the blocks that the ST has been slowly adding to the alpha version of Scratch 2.0 have very diverse uses, and help in one way or another by making certain projects easier to make, or simply adding new interactive features for people to experiment with.
However the one block that confuses me as far as it's reason for being included is the “days since 2000” block. It's function is quite clear. But from my personal standpoint, it's a bit on the advanced side, and it may intimidate/confuse the majority of Scratchers, in terms of manipulating the information. After all, the new “local” block can do pretty much anything you need when it comes to time. Although the block may be a nice challenge for advanced users who want to learn how to manipulate the raw number and apply all of the leap year rules, I feel that the drawbacks outweigh the benefits.
What are your thoughts? Is this block all that useful?
(Note: I was able to come up with one use for the block, which is for a “countdown” type of project. But nothing else really)
