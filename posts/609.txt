I'm not sure if all of your messages should be marked as read as soon as you visit the messages page. That's like saying that all of your messages should be marked as read immediately when you open hotmail/gmail/outlook. Doesn't make sense to me. Perhaps you could mark individual messages as read by either clicking on them to read the message *or* clicking some kind of certain button/icon?
Hmm… well, it's not the same as email really, because many of the messages will be about love its, favorites, etc. Also, comments tend to be shorter than emails. If you make people click the comment ones to mark them read, then you have to make them click the others too. That's a lot of clicks. Or I spose you could have a “mark all as read” button.
Hmm.  It's true though, it could get confusing to remember where you left off responding just by the date / location.  Maybe we should have the “comment” notifications indicate when they've been replied to automatically? That could be nice when, for example, you respond to a comment on a project, and *then* check your messages. Even though you've only just checked your messages, that comment message shouldn't really be “new” if you've already responded to it. What do you think?

Also, if your comment was on a featured project, I can sense it'll be annoying o dig it out to look for a reply. Ideally you should be linked to the comment thread, like in the old ScratchR, and when you click it the message is marked as read, and maybe even deleted.
Totally agree, and brought this up at one point in the past. Not sure if it made it onto the “To Do” list but I'll see what I can do. There are over 9000 things on that list I'm afraid, but that does seem like an important one. If it doesn't happen before the release, by all means remind us and we'll get it after!
