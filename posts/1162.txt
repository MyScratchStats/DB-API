Problem: Whenever I use circles for a picture and switch to another window and try to edit it again, the circles go all over the place. Anyone notice that bug?
Yeah!
I was drawing a bunch of lollipops on a background for the blog post. I grouped the pink lollipop-tops to the sticks, then moved on to the scripts. When I went back to the background, the lollipop-tops had been displaced about 200px northeast.
I don't like how new backgrounds are a huge white rectangle, it should be clear (checkered). Also, you can't spawn a text box on a rectangle, so it's annoying.
