I'm doing a school project on augmented reality, and I wondered, is it possible to do this sort of thing on scratch? i.e: You show the webcam a picture, and something happens?
All suggestions welcome!
it may, however be a bit limited, Scratch doesn't have many video blocks that would help with this sort of thing, but it could be done.
