In 1.4, you can drag a script into another sprite and it copies over. This is a useful feature that I've always liked and was wondering if it would still be available in 2.0? I was trying it just a second ago and it didn't seem to work.
A workaround, I guess, would be to duplicate the sprite, but sometimes I don't think that would be a solution. If I already had two different sprites and wanted just one of the scripts in the first to be in the second, I could just drag it onto the thumbnail. This was helpful to me if I didn't want the sprites to be exactly alike, but didn't want to redo the whole script again in the other one.
Thanks.
