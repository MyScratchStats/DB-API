It's not supposed to be smooth in turbo mode because turbo mode only refreshes the screen when the script is finished. It's the same thing as running a glide block without screen refresh— anything that takes time gets screwed up, as it should.

Yup. I think there's a misconception that turbo mode is just “go faster” mode - which isn't exactly the case, so things will behave differently.
And to echo turkey3, check the date of the thread you're posting on. If it's old, please make absolutely sure that there's a need to do so and what you're posting is still relevant.
