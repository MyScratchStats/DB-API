Yeah, the different colors do confuse me a bit. I'm not disliking it just for the sake of change, but the problem is that this makes all previous pictures, projects, and books made with screenshots of scripts completely outdated. That might seem like an unimportant issue since Scratch 2.0 is such a huge change, but this kind of change is the equivalent of changing a language's syntax! Sure, some minor changes of the tints of blocks (like to distinct between “Control” and Events“) is okay with me - but pen and data? Right now, there's a dark blue (motion), medium blue (sensing), light blue (pen), and a green-ish blue (pen)! Let's try to be practical here.
I would probably be more satisfied if pen could simply get it's old color back, and data was light-blue instead.
Although I'll also agree with your description, ”eye-burning brighter". Some of the colors - particularly for pen, operators, and control, are a lot less appealing to me simply because it makes looking at scripts and reading their text a bit more difficult. Perhaps the colors aren't *that* much brighter, but considering the words aren't as clearly-defined as in Scratch 1.4 because of the different font, it's an issue to keep in mind. Just a subtle adjustment would be nice imo.
