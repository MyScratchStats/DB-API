P.S: My sister, Thunderclaw-, thinks it's unfair that I get the access code and she doesn't.

Now you get bragging rights.
You can still tell her about it though.
Yay!!!
Except that my sister hates it when I brag..like when I was the Scratch curator, I was extremely happy and I started bragging, and we got into an argument…so I can tell her the code? It said not to tell anybody in the message.
