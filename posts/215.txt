1) How did you get access? You're not a curator or anything?
2) Even if a dishonest person did get the code, they can't login with their account, only one of the esters accounts, which there isn't much of a way to prevent. Hopefully none of the people the Scratch Team selected for curator, SDS curator, COLLAB counselor and TBG mods aren't dishonest people anyway, they have important jobs.
