I really liked all the new blocks, especially the cloud variables, which gives me a ton of ideas. The only thing I found quite frustration was the paint editor. I really don't like the way the paint editor is set up, and the way the shapes are formed. Although the new features are cool in the paint editor, its not really what I expected. If you could edit the paint editor so the shapes are formed like in scratch 1.4, then that'll be great
and if you could also post a tutorial on it when scratch 2.0 is out since I am not used to the new paint editor, please do so
Awesome! Thanks for the feedback.
We've hired a whole new programmer to work on the paint editor, and we think they'll be releasing a better (but still not done) version in a week or so. We'll post a link to it in these forums when we do, so you guys can all test it out.
Oh and I totally agree about a tutorial for the new editor - we're going to start on that as soon as it's mostly finalized.

I was shocked at how much better it was than I pictured it. It's AWESOME!!! I really like the cloud feature, because then we can so things like keep high scores or make progress passcodes. <3 this!
Awesome! That's really good to hear.
