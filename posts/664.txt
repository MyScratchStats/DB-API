Those of us who were here first might remember there was a block called “clone me” that was replaced by “create clone of: sprite”. While that removed the need for a sprite to check if it is not a clone before it makes a copy, it created a problem:
“clone me” would always copy the object it was put in.
but “create clone of: sprite” always creates another copy of the original parent sprite.

Example:
If I first clone this sprite:
resulting in two:
then I change the second one to a different costume:
and then the second sprite uses “clone me” to copy itself again:
The result is this:
… this is correct because the clone copied
itself
, it didn't copy its parent.
Now lets use the new “create clone of: sprite” block:
I first clone this sprite:
resulting in two:
then I change the second one's costume:
and then the second sprite uses “create clone of: sprite”
The result:
The clone just made another copy of its parent.
This is exactly what should happen if I use “create clone of: sprite”. The problem is that there is no longer an option to clone
“Me”
.

Problem:
This makes it impossible for successive generations to pass on their properties to their children, and then to their grandchildren, etc. Any problems relating to variables are caused by this.
These properties include:
-costume
-graphic effects
-size
-layer
-variables
-lists
-direction
-pen properties
- - - - - - - - - - -
Solution Proposal:
All that is needed to fix this is the option to clone the object the block is put in, like this:
Please give feedback! Thanks!
