And why use 2000 instead of the much more useful and standard Unix time 1970?
We thought about calling the block “days of Scratch” (or “Scratch time”) and making it report the number of days since May 15, 2007 (the day that Scratch was launched).
Do you think that would be better or worse than “days since 2000”?
It's cool in that it gives an easy method of comparison for Scratch-related events.
However 2000 seems a lot more standardised and therefore clearer.
