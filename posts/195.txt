Hi there, I just wanted to ask, if only a few of us were chosen to be testers, how many of us were chosen and why us? Just curious
Thanks!
Well, we wanted some more testers from the community, and thought it would be good to invite people who've contributed in certain ways first. So we invited all past curators, SDS curators, collab counselors, and TBGmods (see this post:

) It's around 100 + Scratchers.
