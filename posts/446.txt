I used it in my billion button project, but I don't know if it works.
One use is to see how many days since something, or to something. Since yesterday was 4565 or something days since 2000, today is 4565 (or something) + 1. and so the number of days since yesterday is the days since 2000 minus the days since 2000 yesterday, or 4566-4565. Which is one.
