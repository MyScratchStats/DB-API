One way to handle this would be to have a menu option on variable monitors to control how many digits to show after the decimal point. I'll add this to the feature “wish list”.
The “join” trick is clever. It works by forcing the to be represented as a string with many digits of precision. Then the variable monitor sees it as a string, not a number, and doesn't do any rounding.
Thanks for the suggestion!
