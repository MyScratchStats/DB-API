I really enjoyed all of the new changes. I have a ton of questions but I'm sure there is another topic for that. I like how you can see when people joined, the “Projects related to this” section which I played with for a while, the new My Stuff and Profile and all of the new things about the Scratch program itself like the backpack, the new blocks, the new colors and the online feature.
I said I would ask my questions somewhere else, but here's something I found confusing. Is there a way to make it so people can only vote once for surveys like the color one or can they vote as much as they want? If you could control this, that would be great.
Good job and I can't wait for it to be released!
