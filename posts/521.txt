I just made my first 2.0 project,
Bit Art
. A few glitches/bugs/annoying things I noticed were:
Either comments aren't implemented, or they're not intuitive; either way I didn't figure out how to add them…
I couldn't find the  C block.
When LS97 commented and I clicked on the @link, I was taken to an error page:

Cloud lists are kind of slow, there should be a cloud broadcast facility so that you can download a large list on demand, rather than cache every few seconds.
Cloning is awesome! I love how clones auto-delete when you press the stop button, and don't show up in the palette. Well though-out. But please make sure all speech bubbles are removed when the clones are deleted, though; I once had a set of 121 speech-bubbles of clones which were deleted, and no idea how to delete them. I had to start afresh.
No change in the newsfeed on the main page for some reason
EDIT: 7. My list doesn't work…
Comments are a thing of the future.
What C block?
Doesn't seem to happen again.
Sounds cool!
Oh, that sounds bad. That is on the list of things to do. It's been there for several months…
Which, the
What's happening?
feed?
Odd, it works for me. EDIT: No, only in preview it works. :S
Boo!
“All at once”, sorry for not mentioning it…
Umm, I really have no idea how to respond to that.
Great.
Yeah.
Who do we get to fix it?
