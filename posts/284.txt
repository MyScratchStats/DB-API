Whenever I try to click from the homepage to the forums to making a project, I get a popup dialouge that says “Are you sure you want to leave this page?” with the content as “null”.
Annoying.
woah, that sounds like a good one! Can you
take a screen shot
, and post it here? Or you could email it to
help@scratch.mit.edu
if that's easier.
Also, what OS, browser (name and version) are you using?
And, just so I know, are the steps to reproduce as follows:
1. Click create, start making a project
2. Click forums,
3. Dialog appears (with title, but contents are Null?)
Please correct me if I've got it wrong! Thanks.
Edit: Btw, awesome sig.
