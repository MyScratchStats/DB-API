forest
I haven't explored all the features yet. one thing that was really frustrating was finding the menu to delete a background.. or a costume for a sprite.. i eventually found it but would not stay on the screen long enough for me to use it .
Shift clicking sometimes works better than right clicking.

Also in general layout..is it still possible to view who has loved and favourited a project? (not just a function to love or to favourite a project).
Not at the moment.
forest
Is there still the capability to create a new gallery.. as that was not obvious.
Yes. Go to My Stuff (the folder icon), click galleries, and click + new gallery.
