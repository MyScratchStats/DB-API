v158
Changes:
- new block colors (“More Blocks” changed; switched events and control)
- bug: changing cursors in the paint editor crashed the Flash plugin on Linux (worked around for now)
- added a font fallback system to hopefully fix a problem with disappearing block text reported by a user (on Win XP, we think)
- bug: hour/minute/second reporter
