On the upper-right hand part of the screen, click on the folder icon with the S on it to access your “My Stuff” page. There you can see a list of all of your projects (both those you have uploaded and not uploaded). Find the project that you want to delete, and select the “delete” button for it. If the project you want to delete is currently shared publicly, then you have to unshare it first, and then delete it. I hope that helps!
