Looks great so far, thanks for letting me test! My first impressions are:
-Love the “Scene” blocks in events.
-Nice to build blocks without BYOB.
-All I can say here is “YAY CLONES!!”!
-I was a bit disappointed that there was no “Color of Pixel (X), (Y)” block, like Panther has. It would be insanely useful for color mapping, raytracing, texturing, etc.
-It's nice to have “Ceiling” and “Floor” blocks. You can make your own, but…
-A nifty feature that is slightly unnecessary, but still fun is that you can see your soundtrack play.
-About the paint editor: Is it one of the bugs or are there just no snip/stamp tools? I know there's something similar, but what if you want to, say, move an exact rectangle from the scratch cat?
- The pencil tool in the paint editor is truly awesome. I've been waiting for one of those in scratch for several years now.
Anyways, I could go on and on about more minor aspects, but I want to keep exploring the interface
Thanks so much scratch team!
(By the way, is it all right if my brother WATCHES me scratch in 2.0? Maybe points out some things about it for testing?)
