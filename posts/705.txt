Yeah, the survey showed that they aren't very accurate / useful in a lot of ways.
Our current thinking is to only allow the owner of a project to make tags for it - hopefully that'll cut down on the noise some. There was some talk of limiting the number of tags as well (to maybe around 3).
Do you have any thoughts on tags?
