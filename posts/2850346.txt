Bumping the oldest topic that I could find that I can post on

IDK why I didn't know about necroposting
Necroposting is usually used to annoy people and/or disrupt the forums by bumping topics that were fixed years ago, and in this case, 5 years ago. By doing this you just make it harder to find and contribute to glitches that actually need to be fixed.
I'm reporting this topic to be closed.
