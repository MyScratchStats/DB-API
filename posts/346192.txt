You can have them post with their actual username in the comment section so you know it's actually them.
I guess. I should have them post the userID, so then I can manually add it…
That'd work for like, Collaboration Job Boards, but not for like, normal chatrooms.
I hope i'm not necroposting, but what is a userID?
You are necroposting. The userID is a number used in the code to identify users, along with their username. It's different from the former
User ID block
, which gave users an arbitrary, anonymous id to identify them instead of using their username.
But it's a justifiable necropost.
