This should help clarify:

We just invited about 100 or so new testers, but many of them may be inactive (past curators from a long time ago, especially).
Your projects *may* come with you when we release, but we can't guarantee it, so if you really love something, you should download a copy and save it. Even that we can't totally guarantee, b/c we might have to change the format a little, but that seems less and less likely as time goes on.
Also, how much can we reveal to the public? Screenshots? Info?
