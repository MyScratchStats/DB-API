Actually, that last one isn't a problem– or at least not an added issue since the old forums.
When somebody posts a swear that gets censored, it appears as * in the forums but when quoted shows the original word.
In any case it's a lot more probable that a troll would want to show the swear to the general public (i.e. normal readers) rather than that 1% who would have a reason to quote the post.
