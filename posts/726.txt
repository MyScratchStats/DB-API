Well, save is definitely not my favorite thing to do, but that doesn't mean it isn't important to know. It totally needs a change, and a simpler interface; but we also need to consider the fact that pretty much every desktop document-based application uses the same model, so something had to be good about that (namely, you can control when to save/not save, control where to save, and can open a document intuitively).
I agree someone needs to think of a better way to save, I just don't think auto-save is the way to go. You need some degree of freedom, otherwise a few years into the future I can imagine someone saying “Remember how you lost all your work when you accidentally deleted a sprite and it was auto-saved? Or when your browser crashed during an auto-save and your project got corrupted?”
For the record, just speaking for myself, permanence is often scarier than free experimentation. When you have a big project which you want to add a new feature to, you're always calmer making the big change if you knew you could always go back if you messed up. And I mess up a lot.
