can't you just edit the size to this though by just editing the tag
I was wondering….maybe make an auto lock or something like that for the big & small thing.
Edit:
Also, you could make a header thingamagig thing in the forum options for you to choose where you can put a certain heading. Maybe max 50 characters for a header so no spammers and a bigger size font choice for the heading. And lock the body to maximum of 32.
Ehh, I think that just restrictions on size would be fine, even going so far to say that size could be enabled completley untill it's abused…
The syntax is weird though…
Hey,
that could be an
advantage!
Trolls wouldn't assume that it's a different pattern from other BBCode, and would just post broken links, then mods would remove it before they realized that it was wrong.
or possibly my head lives in a perfect world
i mean perfixed
