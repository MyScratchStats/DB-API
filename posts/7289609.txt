This suggestion is obsolete because we now have standards set for user-generated content saved in projects. I think the best example of this is the rules about cloud chatrooms. You aren't allowed to create projects that require moderation, so we don't need the owner to moderate it at all.
User-generated content is still here…
They said there were now rules about it, not that it was no longer here.
Anyway, they decided to prevent cloud chatrooms because of moderation concerns (they said it would be until they could clear them up, but that never actually happened so they decided to reject allowing them).
