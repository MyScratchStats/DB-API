I also just got the bug.
I don't know how I got it to happen. Today I just logged in, and BAM! No text.
The problem is that the bug is on ALL of my projects, and when I create a new one - it's there too!
Windows 7
Google Chrome
Flash version 11. something. Probably the same as zorket above, as there is no other 11. something flash version, I think.
So, I'm kinda stuck. Not able to create any projects, as far as I know. NOOOOOO!!!
Bummer!  I'm running pretty much the same combination with no trouble.  Have you tried clearing your cache and restarting your browser?  Also, if you have other browsers on your computer, it would be useful to know if the problem is showing up in them.
