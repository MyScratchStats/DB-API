I really liked all the new blocks, especially the cloud variables, which gives me a ton of ideas. The only thing I found quite frustration was the paint editor. I really don't like the way the paint editor is set up, and the way the shapes are formed. Although the new features are cool in the paint editor, its not really what I expected. If you could edit the paint editor so the shapes are formed like in scratch 1.4, then that'll be great
and if you could also post a tutorial on it when scratch 2.0 is out since I am not used to the new paint editor, please do so
