How about:
It autosaves the project as it does now.
When the user clicks SHARE, the project is shared to the public.
The user is free to edit it and the project will autosave,
however
it will not show to the public until the user clicks RESHARE.
There could optionally be a button called REVERT TO SHARED VERSION for bloopers.
I think that's simple and convenient. A lot easier that what is being currently forced.
