Ah, this is a little different, since it would only appear when you are a curator on the gallery on which you are commenting. I don't believe this is implemented yet, and we're kind of trying to keep the to do list as small as we can so we can focus on squashing bugs / finishing implementation of key features. But I think it's something we should consider.
Keep in mind that we plan to keep working on / developing after the release. In the past we kinda stopped (we've changed very little about the site / application in the last several years), but this is a different situation. So we'll be pushing changes / patches / new designs / little features like this one for a while after the release.
