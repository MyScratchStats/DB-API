I've just tried the editor out and I'd plead to have a switch to bit-mapped editor option!
Its great to have a super-duper vector drawing - advanced users will be able to achieve great things BUT it will  introduce a large barrier with younger/less able pupils and classroom educators.
The “paint” concept is something that is taught/learnt as a basic skill.
When I come to teach Scratch - 85% of pupils/teachers understand and can use the 1.4 editor with minimal instruction and get onto the programming side very quickly.
This is a baby and bath-water situation we have here
Or to put it into Scratch Language  - the low floor has been raised and increased the barrier to entry.
