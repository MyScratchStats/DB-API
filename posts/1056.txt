OK, here's what happens:
I ran Chrome and went to my chess game page.
I clicked the “see inside” button and nothing happened.  Then I pressed Shift-Ctrl-I to open the console.  Next, I pressed the “see inside” button and it actually went into the editor!
So, thinking that maybe that unstuck something, I went to IE and tried to go into the editor… nothing.
At least I can use it on Chrome.  But, this is something that will need to be fixed for the final release–because I'm not the only person to see this behavior.  And, IE is still the most common browser in North America.
