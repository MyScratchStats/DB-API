I like the My Stuff page too. Are there any ways to view other users' profiles in the same manner?
Actually, on the old site, My Stuff used to be what the “profile” is now. Now it means a place that only you can see, where you can organize your projects (shared or unshared). So nobody can see anyone else's my stuff. It's sort of more literally “my stuff”.
